## Important assembly notes

1. The flanged button head screws sourced for attaching the drawer slides to the aluminum extrusion rails don't quite fit through the holes/slots in some of the drawer slide tracks. Use a 1/2" drill bit to widen these slots just enough for the screw heads to fit through.

1. Be sure to add a diagonal 2x4 beam under the table surface, as shown in the 2x4Basic's (legs) assembly manual. Double check the length needed, but I _think_ it was 50".

1. Be very careful when attaching the inner drawer slide tracks to the sliding MDF base! Pre-drill the holes using the tracks as a template. Make sure the tracks are aligned correctly so they match the slides on the frame. Drill and screw them as close as possible to the center of the board to minimize risk of delaminating the board later. Use either MDF or particle board - layered plywood may separate.

1. Use a 2-3/8" hole saw to drill a hole for the furniture grommet on the table surface near the back of the enclosure. Make absolutely sure that you're not drilling into the diagonal 2x4 crossbeam!
